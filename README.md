# CircleTick: The Digital Clock

CircleTime is a simple digital clock application built with Python and Pygame. It displays the current time inside a stylish circular design, updating every second. This project combines elegance with simplicity, offering a unique way to keep track of time.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system
- Pygame library installed (`pip install pygame`)

## Usage

1. **Clone or download the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/circletime.git
   cd circletime
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python circle_time_clock.py
Interact with the clock:

The clock will display the current time inside a circle.
Close the application by clicking the close button on the window.
How it Works
The script initializes Pygame to create a window and draws a circle in the center of the screen. It then retrieves the current time and renders it as text, positioning it at the center of the circle. The display updates every second to reflect the current time.

Customization
You can customize the script by adjusting parameters such as screen dimensions, font size, and colors. Additionally, you can modify the update frequency to make the clock update faster or slower.
